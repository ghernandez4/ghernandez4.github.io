1. When the game starts, the snake will start at just 1 block long (the head). The player will use the arrow keys to move the snake around the board. When the snake's head is over the apple, the apple will disappear and the snake's length will increase by 1, being added to the tail.
2. The game will begin when the player starts moving, the apple will have spawned before the game starts.
3. The game will end when the snake collides with the wall, itself, or when the snake's length is 1 less than the size of the board.
4. if (positionX === wall.length) {end}, if (positionX === -1) {end}, if (positionY === 0) {end}, if (positionY === wall.height) {end}, if (positionX === body.x && positionY === body.y) {end}, if (snake.length === board.width * board.width - 1) {end}

5. The board (static), apple (static), snake (animated)
6. board, apple, snake, count

7. on keyboard press, change direction; on tick, check for new direction, update position of the snake, and check for collision with itself, the wall, or the apple.
8. the keyboard press detect event will change the direction value of the snake, the check for new direction event will use the direction value to determine the speed changes that need to take place, the update position event will check if the snake collides with itself or the wall, then it will end the game, or if it collides with the apple, then it will remove the apple, create a new apple in a new spot, and increase the length of the snake by 1, and change the x and y values of the snake.
